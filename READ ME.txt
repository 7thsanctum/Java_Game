Student Matric - 10006179
-------------------------

This is the coursework submission for SET09101. Java coursework for John Owens.

I have included a Runnable JAR file as well as a Non-Runnable JAR for your preference as well as including all of the class files in the workspace folder.

I have also included two use case diagrams. One was modelled with the Eclipse at university and the other was modelled at home with a different application.

Both contain the same classes and only have minor aesthetic differences.

The report is labelled SD3.docx

Thanks for the consideration.
